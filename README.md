# Biomedical Imaging
This repository contains projects related to the topic of biomedical imaging and its analysis. Biomedical imaging is an essential aspect of modern medicine, providing valuable insights into the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of various medical conditions.

This repository provides an introduction to the underlying principles of various biomedical imaging modalities such as Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), and others. It also covers their clinical use, advantages, and limitations. In addition,  methods currently being used for biomedical image processing and analysis are introduced. This includes image registration, segmentation, and morphological analysis. The emphasis is on practical applications and techniques used in current biomedical research. Also, an introduction to advanced machine learning and deep learning technologies in medical imaging for highly accurate analysis is providded. It covers topics such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.
